            What I love most about my AirPods Max is their incredible design. From
            the cushion to the canopy, every part is crafted for an uncompromising
            fit. They create the perfect acoustic seal that fits comfortably on my
            head and fully immerses me in every sound and allows me to listen to
            my music for a long time.
